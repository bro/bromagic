# windows:  file(1) magic for Microsoft Windows
#
# This file is mainly reserved for files where programs
# using them are run almost always on MS Windows 3.x or
# above, or files only used exclusively in Windows OS,
# where there is no better category to allocate for.
# For example, even though WinZIP almost run on Windows
# only, it is better to treat them as "archive" instead.
# For format usable in DOS, such as generic executable
# format, please specify under "msdos" file.
