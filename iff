# iff:	file(1) magic for Interchange File Format (see also "audio" & "images")
#
# Daniel Quinlan (quinlan@yggdrasil.com) -- IFF was designed by Electronic
# Arts for file interchange.  It has also been used by Apple, SGI, and
# especially Commodore-Amiga.
#
# IFF files begin with an 8 byte FORM header, followed by a 4 character
# FORM type, which is followed by the first chunk in the FORM.

0	string		FORM		IFF data
#>4	belong		x		\b, FORM is %d bytes long
# audio formats
>8	string		AIFF		\b, AIFF audio
!:mime	audio/x-aiff
>8	string		AIFC		\b, AIFF-C compressed audio
!:mime	audio/x-aiff
>8	string		8SVX		\b, 8SVX 8-bit sampled sound voice
!:mime	audio/x-aiff
