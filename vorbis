# vorbis:  file(1) magic for Ogg/Vorbis files

#
# Most (everything but the number of channels and bitrate) is commented
# out with `##' as it's not interesting to the average user.  The most
# probable things advanced users would want to uncomment are probably
# the number of comments and the encoder version.
#
# FIXME: The first match has been made a search, so that it can skip
# over prepended ID3 tags. This will work for MIME type detection, but
# won't work for detecting other properties of the file (they all need
# to be made relative to the search). In any case, if the file has ID3
# tags, the ID3 information will be printed, not the Ogg information,
# so until that's fixed, this doesn't matter.
# FIXME[2]: Disable the above for now, since search assumes text mode.
