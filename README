BroMagic
========

A custom magic database for use with libmagic (www.darwinsys.com/file).
The main purpose of maintaining the separate database is so that results
are more deterministic and independent from the particular version of
libmagic that's installed, which comes with its own default database.
This repository is originally derived from the the default database of
libmagic version 5.14, but with much of the rules taken out that had no
corresponding mime type or weren't compatible with versions as old as
5.04.
